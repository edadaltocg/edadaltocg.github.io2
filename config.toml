description = "Hi there! Welcome to my personal website. I'm an AI researcher with experience in both academia and startups. I co-founded Future Frame in San Francisco and Paris, where we used advanced transformer models to transform data science by removing biases from traditional methods. Our API platform allowed data scientists to easily work with our innovations. I completed my PhD in Machine Learning at CentraleSup√©lec, focusing on making AI systems more secure and trustworthy, particularly in fields like computer vision and medical imaging. My background includes a research internship in Montreal and degrees from ISAE-SUPAERO and ITA in Brazil. I'm passionate about creating AI that's not only powerful but also truly human-centered and reliable. Thanks for stopping by to learn more about my work!."
