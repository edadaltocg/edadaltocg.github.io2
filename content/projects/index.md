### Open-source

**[Detectors](https://github.com/edadaltocg/detectors)** _May 2023_

Open source package to accelerate research on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for computer vision applications.

This library is aimed at assisting researchers in the field of generalized OOD detection. It is inspired by [HF's Transformers](https://https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and features implementations of baselines, metrics, and data sets that allow researchers to perform meaningful benchmarking and development of ood detection methods. It features:

- `methods`: more than 20 detection methods implemented.
- `pipelines`: evaluating OOD detectors on popular benchmarks, such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet benchmarks with random seed support for reproducibility.
- `datasets`: OOD datasets implemented with md5 checksums and without the need to download them manually.
- `models`: model architectures totally integrated with [`timm`](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models).
- `eval`: implementation of fast OOD evaluation metrics.
- Several aggregation methods for multi-layer OOD detection.
- Pipelines for open set recognition and covariate drift detection.

### Hackatons

**BCG Gamma Deep Learning Hackathon**
_February 2020, São José dos Campos, Brazil_

Organized in joint collaboration between the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA) and BCG Gamma Brazil. We fine-tuned a YOLOv3 model for high-precision object detection from infrared drone footage receiving the Best Presentation Award. The project was advised by Prof. [Filipe Verri](https://comp.ita.br/~verri/).

### Aerodynamics

I was involved in research projects in the field of aerospace engineering and aerodynamics theory for airplanes and rocketships being awarded a national scholarship from the [CNPq](https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br) for studying wavy leading edge phenomena with computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

### Prompt Riddle

As a fun side project, I co-developed [promptriddle](https://promptriddle.com), a challenging enigma solving game on an emulated terminal with over 2000 players in our Discord community server.

### Volunteering

I volunteered as a high school math teacher at a Brazilian public school, at the social action club at ITA called CASSIS, and at the entrepreneurship league during my bachelors.
