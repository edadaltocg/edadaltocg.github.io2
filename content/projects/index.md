## Rocketry

There, I was involved in research projects in the field of aerospace engineering and aerodynamics theory for airplanes and rocketships being awarded a national scholarship from the [CNPq](https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br) for studying wavy leading edge phenomena with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Details about the project.

Also, I ran experiments in the wind tunnel of the ITA for the development of a sounding rocket for the [2018's Spaceport America Cup](https://spaceportamericacup.com/).
2017 the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition's (IREC).
