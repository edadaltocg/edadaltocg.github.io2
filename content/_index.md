Hi! I'm a researcher in AI with a brief entrepreneurship experience. I co-founded Future Frame between April and November 2024, split between San Francisco and Paris, with the goal of eliminating the constraints of traditional feature engineering by adapting transformer models to handle structured data effectively. This led to us launching an API platform designed for data scientists, making it easy for them to fine-tune and run inferences with our model. We were thrilled to secure pre-seed funding from [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com/) and the VC firm [Transpose](https://www.transposeplatform.vc/) and to be part of the vibrant community at [Station F](https://stationf.co/).

Previously, I was a PhD student in Machine Learning at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) - [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), under the supervision of Prof. [Pablo Piantanida](http://webpages.lss.supelec.fr/perso/pablo.piantanida/Welcome.html). My PhD was supported by [BPI France](https://www.bpifrance.com/) through the [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) project called AIDA: Artificial Intelligence for Digital Automation. I mainly worked on the topic of inference time out-of-distribution detection and rejection option for securing human-machine interactions, applied to natural images, text, and medical images. I successfully defended my thesis in March 2024.

In 2022, I did a graduate research internship in partnership with the ILLS laboratory and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) in Montreal. I obtained my master's degree from [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/) in Toulouse and my bachelor's degree from the [Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA)](https://ita.br/) in Brazil.

Broadly, I am interested in developing robust machine learning algorithms and applications that involve human-machine interaction.
