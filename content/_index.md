Hi! I'm a researcher in AI with brief experience in entrepreneurship. I co-founded Future Frame between April and November 2024, based in San Francisco and Paris. Our goal was to eliminate the constraints and biases of traditional feature engineering by leveraging transfer learning with custom-designed transformer models that effectively handle structured data on novel downstream tasks. We launched an API platform for data scientists, making it easy for them to fine-tune and run inferences with our model. We were thrilled to secure pre-seed funding from [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com/) and the VC firm [Transpose](https://www.transposeplatform.vc/), and to be part of the vibrant community at [Station F](https://stationf.co/).

Previously, I earned a PhD in Machine Learning from [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) - [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), under the supervision of Prof. [Pablo Piantanida](https://sites.google.com/mila.quebec/pablo-piantanida/home). My PhD was funded by [BPI France](https://www.bpifrance.com/) through the [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) project AIDA: Artificial Intelligence for Digital Automation. I primarily focused on Safety AI topics, including out-of-distribution detection and rejection option to secure and enhance the robustness of deep learning systems, applied to computer vision, NLP, and medical imaging. I successfully defended my thesis in March 2024.

In 2022, I did a graduate research internship in the ILLS laboratory in partnership with [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) in Montreal. I obtained my master's degree from [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/) in Toulouse and my bachelor's degree from the [Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA)](https://ita.br/) in Brazil.

Broadly, I am interested in developing robust general purpose machine learning algorithms that are human-centric and trustworthy.
