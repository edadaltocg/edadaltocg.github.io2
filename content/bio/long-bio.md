I am a PhD Candidate in Machine Learning at [CentraleSupélec](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/)-[Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) working towards **safe and robust AI** under the supervision of Prof. [Pablo Piantanida](http://webpages.lss.supelec.fr/perso/pablo.piantanida/Welcome.html).
My PhD is supported by the [BPI France](https://www.bpifrance.com/) through the [IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/) project [AIDA: Artificial Intelligence for Digital Automation](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/news/artificial-intelligence-digital-automation-aida-promising-joint-public-private-project-ai).
Through my work, I hope to contribute to the betterment of society by developing responsible and safe algorithms.

In 2023, I was selected to participate in [the Nordic Probabilistic AI School (ProbAI)](https://probabilistic.ai/#about) in Trondheim, Norway.
In 2022, I was awarded the [MITACS Globalink scholarship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink) for a four-month research internship at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [ÉTS](https://www.etsmtl.ca/) in Montreal, QC, Canada.
In 2021, I got my [first first-author paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07798) accepted at ([ICLR2022](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2022/CallForPapers)).

Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from the [Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA)](https://ita.br/) in Brazil. ITA is the top-1 engineering school in Brazil with a selective admission process with an acceptance rate of 2%.

<!-- There, I was involved in research projects in the field of aerospace engineering and aerodynamics theory for airplanes and rocketships being awarded a national scholarship from the [CNPq](https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br) for studying wavy leading edge phenomena with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Also, I ran experiments in the wind tunnel of the ITA for the development of a sounding rocket for the [2018's Spaceport America Cup](https://spaceportamericacup.com/). -->

In 2018, I was awarded an excellence scholarship to pursue my master's degree at [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/) in Toulouse, France. There, I was selected for the Data Science and Applied Mathematics major. During my master's, I was involved in a research project at the intersection of machine learning and communication systems leading to my first journal publication.

<!-- I also did free-lance work for [Liebherr Engineering](https://www.liebherr.com/en/int/products/components/engineering/engineering.html) in the field of data science. -->

As a fun side project, I co-developed [promptriddle](https://promptriddle.com), a challenging enigma solving game on an emulated terminal with over 2000 players.
